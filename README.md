## Introduction 📖
In 2024, I joined the _Iungo Solutions_ Bootcamp to dive into the professional world of Games Development. Our main focus has been learning the basic concepts of game programming and 2D art on the Unity Editor Engine. As part of the first small project, I created my own version of _Flappy Bird_.
